## Need to test

- Improve the test generator:

  - Make all generators have better strategies
- Test Apollo legendary with torches - seems to be a different Trait
- Test Dio keepsake - maybe it stays as a different keepsake in followup biomes.
- Make a benchmark for number of messages sent to twitch. Make sure it is below 100/min. Also, add a warning log if we get close.
